<h2>Description</h2>

Easy to make vanilla cake. Perfect for Birthdays, Holidays, etc
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 Sticks Unsalted Butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans</li>
  <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1 1/4 cups sugar</li>
  <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
  <li>1 1/4 cups whole milk (or 3/4 cup heavy cream mixed with 1/2 cup water)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
  <li>Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust the pans with flour, tapping out the excess.</li>
  <li>Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined.</li>
  <li>Beat 2 sticks butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. </li>
  <li>Beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with flour, until just smooth.</li>
  <li>Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are lightly golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. </li>
  <li>Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. </li>
  <li>Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level, if desired.</li>
</ol>
